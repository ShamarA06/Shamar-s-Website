  Welcome to my website Been One!,My name is Shamar Aitcheson, and i've named my website been one because ever since I was younger i've always been very passionate and driven about anything i've wanted to do. Been One is actually one of my favorite albums from one of my favorite artists Rylo Rodriguez. When I was a child I used to play with legos, spending hours building until it was perfect, and then 9th grade year when I took machine and robotics I became more fond of code, and building functional machines. I've also been very passionate about music, being a producer for now almost 4 years I have grown so much skill and talent in making beats, and building connections to get my name more heard in the music industry. This is why I resonate with the term Been One, never give up on yourself always continue trying to push to be better than you already were to truly shine and grow from past challenges that have made you nothing but stronger.
